                    <h2>About Gerardo</h2>
                      <ul>
                        <li>I enjoy reading a good book, outdoor activities, spending
                        time with my wife and kids, and sharing a glass of
                        wine with friends. I'm a Mac fan and recently finished rebuilding
                        a 1990 Mac Classic, which is on my photo for this page. </li>
                        <li>I like music and play piano on my free time. In a former life
                        I played guitar with a rock band. </li>
                        <li>Workwise, I'm in charge of the IT Infrastructure for McKesson
                        Specialty Health. A division of McKesson that
                        supports community oncology and other specialty practices.</li>
                      </ul>
                    <h2>Why am I taking this course?</h2>
                      <ul>
                        <li>I am taking this course as part of the Web Technologies
                        certificate. </li>
                        <li>If everything goes well, I plan to pursue the master's degree
                        concentration in Information Technology. </li>
                        <li>I expect that this course will have practical applications
                        for work, and for personal objectives that I want to explore.</li>
                      </ul>
                    <h2>Previous experience with programming</h2>
                      <ul>
                        <li>I took courses on programming abstractions and computer organization
                         and systems at Stanford, where I learned the basics of C,
                         C++ and some assembly. Last semester I took CSCIE12 at Harvard,
                          where I learned HTML5, CSS, Java Script "hacking", and how to spell PHP.</li>
                      </ul>
                    <h2>Platform</h2>
                      <ul>
                        <li>I am running MAMP on a MacBook pro with OSX Yosemite 10.10.5.
                        The hardware is a few years old and the graphics processor gets
                        hot when processing videos. I changed the hard drive to solid state,
                        which made a nice difference speed-wise. I'm using Atom as my code
                      editor. </li>
                      </ul>
                      <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
                        <ul>
                          <li>I am a remote student based in The Woodlands Tx. If I have
                          a chance, I will try to visit the Harvard campus to meet other
                        students and the teaching staff. Looking forward to it! </li>
