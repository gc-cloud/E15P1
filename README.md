# ESP15 - Project 1
### Portfolio /  Workflow Setup
This project presents a single landing page to access my portfolio at CSCIE15. Place marker links to github and to the expected subdomains are provided initially.   There is also a section to provide the teaching staff some information about me.

### Repository Location
[GitHub gc-cloud E15](github.com/gc-cloud/E15P1)

### Live Site Location
Please visit [zudbu.com](p1.zudbu.com).  This domain is dedicated (for now) to my CSCIE15 work.

### Site organization
Project 1 uses a combination of PHP includes, Java Script and the Skeleton framework
  - The main content is on index.php.  Head, Header and Footer content is obtained from calls to  head.php, header.php and footer.php
  - Collapsible menus are based on the [jQuery User Interface](jqueryui.com)
  - The layout is mobile-first and responsive. To do this, I am using  [Skeleton](getskeleton.com), a very clean and light boilerplate. Specific CSS for this site are defined on zudbu.css
  - We are obtaining the Raleway font from [Google fonts](fonts.googleapis.com)
